                <p>
                    This landmark project, known previously as the former Kapyong Barracks, aspires to be the pride of Winnipeg and the rest of Canada, showcasing the best in Indigenous business, design, arts and culture for generations to come, named Naawi-Oodena, which means “centre of the heart and community” in the Anishinaabe language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Naawi-Oodena, located in southwest Winnipeg about seven kilometres from downtown, formerly a military site, now undergoing major construction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 2019 agreement between the Canadian government and the Treaty One Nations divided the land, with 68% designated for an Urban Reserve and 32% for Canada Lands Company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The master plan, released in 2021, envisions a mixed-use community with thousands of homes and over a million square feet of commercial space, making it the largest urban Indigenous economic zone in Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan to break down the master plan to present in this website, in the following format:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Residential (lower density and medium density) </li>
                    <li>Commercial Mixed Use</li>
                    <li>Community spaces </li>
                    <li>Sports and Recreation</li>
                    <li>Cultural Campus + Education</li>
                    <li>Mixed-use village</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
