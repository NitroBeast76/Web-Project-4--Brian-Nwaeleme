                <p>
                    Naawi-Oodena, previously known as the Kapyong Barracks and meaning “centre of the heart of the community” in Anishinaabe, is becoming a proud landmark of Winnipeg and a trailblazer for urban Indigenous reserves. Located in southwest Winnipeg, just 7 km from downtown, the 160-acre site is under redevelopment through a partnership between the Treaty One Nations and the Government of Canada, with 68% of the land allocated to the Treaty One Nations and 32% to Canada Lands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After nearly two years of joint planning and public engagement, the master plan for the site was released on March 2021. The vision includes green space, recreation facilities, a variety of housing, and up to 1.2 million square feet of commercial and retail space—accommodating between 2,300 and 3,000 homes. Once complete, Naawi-Oodena now stands as the largest multi-use development in modern Winnipeg history, and the single largest urban Indigenous economic zone in Canada.

                    <p>
                        Medium-density residential areas—known by having a balance of building scale and open space, having between 20 and 50 units per hectare (roughly 5,000 to 12,500 people per square kilometer)—are designed to promote well-planned, multi-unit housing that offers a variety of options for people of all ages, abilities, and income levels. These areas are meant to support more people with well-connected housing, good walkability, and easy access to things like transit and shops—making them a good fit for busier roads like Kenaston Boulevard. It achieves this by:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Diverse housing options</b>: Providing a mix of housing types with varying unit sizes, a range of tenure and lease models, accessible and age-friendly designs, and affordable homes that accommodate all income levels.</li>
                        
                        <li><b>Quality Design</b>: Features high-quality architecture and modern design, ensuring new development contributes to a strong and cohesive community identity.</li>
                    
                        <li><b>Pedestrian Permeability</b>: The design reinforces the relationship between buildings and the street by maintaining a high calibre of passability and activation at ground level.</li>
                    
                        <li><b>Visual Quality</b>: Minimizes the visual impact of parking, service areas, and similar elements on the public realm.</li>

                        <li>Low and mid-rise apartments, usually up to 6 storeys or 20 metres in height (whichever is less),</li>
                        <li>Multi-unit buildings like stacked townhomes,</li>
                        <li>Live-work units, which combine living space and small-scale business use,</li>

                    <p>
                        Lower-density residential areas - have a more spacious built form and reduced population density, having less than 20 units per hectare (about 5,000 people per square kilometre) – promoting well-integrated houses that complement other nearby houses to create a safe neighbourhood feeling, as well as safety, design, and cleanliness. These areas are meant to keep things quieter and more relaxed, with more space between homes and fewer people. They fit best next to existing neighbourhoods where things are already calm, like the western edge of the site, helping new homes blend in without changing the feel of the area. This is done by:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Diverse Housing Options</b>: Providing a variety of housing types with different unit sizes, tenure models, accessible and age-friendly options, and affordable housing to meet a range of household income levels.</li>
                        <li><b>Quality Design</b>: Encouraging good architecture and neighbourhood-friendly design to support a strong and lasting community character.</li>
                        <li><b>Visual Quality</b>: Limiting the impact of parking, service areas, and similar elements to keep the public areas looking clean and welcoming.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>This area includes;</b></p>

                        <li>Townhouses and stacked townhomes,</li>
                        <li>Small multi-unit buildings like triplexes or fourplexes (sometimes called plex-type housing),</li>
                        <li>And secondary suites, such as basement apartments or backyard units.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Most buildings in these areas are up to 3.5 storeys or 12 metres tall, whichever is less, helping preserve the neighbourhood scale. Densities generally fall between 10 and 18 units per acre, offering a balance between space and gentle infill.</p>
