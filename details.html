                    Naawi-Oodena, previously known as the Kapyong Barracks and meaning “centre of the heart of the community” in Anishinaabe, is becoming a proud landmark of Winnipeg and a trailblazer for urban Indigenous reserves. Located in southwest Winnipeg, just 7 km from downtown, the 160-acre site is under redevelopment through a partnership between the Treaty One Nations and the Government of Canada, with 68% of the land allocated to the Treaty One Nations and 32% to Canada Lands.

                <p>
                    After nearly two years of joint planning and public engagement, the master plan for the site was released on March 2021. The vision includes green space, recreation facilities, a variety of housing, and up to 1.2 million square feet of commercial and retail space—accommodating between 2,300 and 3,000 homes. Once complete, Naawi-Oodena now stands as the largest multi-use development in modern Winnipeg history, and the single largest urban Indigenous economic zone in Canada.

                <p>
                    Medium-density residential areas—known by having a balance of building scale and open space, having between 20 and 50 units per hectare (roughly 5,000 to 12,500 people per square kilometer)—are designed to promote well-planned, multi-unit housing that offers a variety of options for people of all ages, abilities, and income levels. It achieves this by:
