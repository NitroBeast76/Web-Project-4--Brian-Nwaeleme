                    Naawi-Oodena, previously known as the Kapyong Barracks and meaning “centre of the heart of the community” in Anishinaabe, has become a proud landmark of Winnipeg and a trailblazer for urban Indigenous reserves. Located in southwest Winnipeg, just 7 km from downtown, the 160-acre site was redeveloped through a partnership between the Treaty One Nations and the Government of Canada, with 68% of the land allocated to the Treaty One Nations and 32% to Canada Lands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After nearly two years of joint planning and public engagement, the master plan for the site was released on March 2021. The vision includes green space, recreation facilities, a variety of housing, and up to 1.2 million square feet of commercial and retail space—accommodating between 2,300 and 3,000 homes. since completion, Naawi-Oodena now stands as the largest multi-use development in modern Winnipeg history, and the single largest urban Indigenous economic zone in Canada.

                <p>
                    A dedicated Sustainability Framework advances four core components, encouraging third-party certifications (e.g., LEED, One Planet Living) and local partnerships:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Sustainable Energy</b>: Promote zero-net-energy buildings, district heating/cooling utilities, passive-solar design, geothermal and solar systems; source durable, locally made/recycled materials; engage community on energy conservation.</li>
                    <li><b>Sustainable Transportation</b>: Target a 50% auto-driver, 15% auto-passenger, 21% transit, 14% walking/cycling mode split; design porous street networks, invest in AT infrastructure, bike- and car-share programs, EV charging; collaborate on Route 90 and rapid-transit integration.</li>
                    <li><b>Green + Blue Infrastructure</b>: Integrate LID strategies (bioswales, rain gardens, green roofs); design stormwater ponds as public amenities with native planting; limit peak flows; includes private ownership/maintenance of SWMFs.</li>
                    <li><b>Community Health + Well-Being</b>: Prioritize active AT routes; embed recreation facilities in Community Spaces; support social-enterprise procurement; maintain ongoing engagement with T1N and neighbours.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><i>Cultural &amp; Architectural Identity</i></h3>
                <p>
                    Cultural expression permeates both built form and public art:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Architecture &amp; Urban Form</b>: Mixed-use and cultural campus buildings reference Indigenous design motifs, use high-quality materials, and emphasize human scale at ground level, reinforcing Treaty 1 identity with Ojibwe-named streets and plazas.</li>
                    <li><b>Public Art (Section 6.3)</b>: Establish a Public Art Advisory, dedicate 1% of capital budgets, prioritize First Nations artists, and integrate works into parks, streetscapes, and landmarks like the Cultural Campus gateway arbour.</li>
                    <li><b>Naming Plan (Section 6.5)</b>: Streets and parks carry Treaty 1 language alongside English, approved by a Naming Council with Knowledge Keeper input; ceremonial spaces and art pieces bear culturally significant names.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><i>Infrastructure &amp; Connectivity</i></h3>
                <p>
                    An integrated Infrastructure Framework ensures phased, coordinated delivery of roads, transit, water, sewer, and utilities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Transportation + Mobility (Section 8.1)</b>: Conducted a Transportation Impact Study; set mode-split targets; prioritize AT and transit; define street hierarchy with complete sidewalks, buffered bike lanes, traffic calming (chicanes, curb bump-outs), and flexible loading/drop-off lanes; plan rapid-transit nodes at Grant Ave. &amp; Route 90.</li>
                    <li><b>Site Servicing Framework (Section 8.2)</b>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Water distribution</b>: connect to existing mains via multiple tie-ins; promote phased installation alongside street construction.</li>
                        <li><b>Wastewater collection</b>: sized for peak flows plus inflow/infiltration; drains to Doncaster Trunk; staged sewer connections.</li>
                        <li><b>Shallow utilities</b>: coordinate with providers for power, telecom and future-proofed distribution corridors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Stormwater Management</b>: Five engineered ponds integrated into parks; LID features across all parcels; native upland and aquatic plantings; adaptable layouts subject to detailed design.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Together, these components establish a phased, resilient framework that aligns land use, design, sustainability, culture, and infrastructure—setting a new benchmark for Indigenous-led urban development.
